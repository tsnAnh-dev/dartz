In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code
that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding and/or using such a code
proceeds by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Ph.D.student
at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes".
